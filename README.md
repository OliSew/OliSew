Hello!

I am a developer without much experience, but I am enthusiastic about learning and improving my skills. I enjoy coding in HTML, Python, CSS, and have a little bit of experience with JavaScript as well. I usually spend around 30 minutes on GitHub, where I like to explore different projects and get inspired by other developers.

Feel free to check out my profile if you're interested in seeing what I'm working on. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
